C:\Program Files\nodejs
(in environment variables)

5. went to folder and opened cmd from the folder
       cmd>npm init playwright@latest



Automation tools with JavaScript
------------------------------------
1. Spec File
2. configuration file

6. Visual studio code: 
https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Note: In playwright spec files executed by default in headless
Note: In playwright by default testspec files will be executed parallely

command to execute script in playwright : npx playwright test --headed

cmd>npx playwright test file.spec.js


test template
test.only
test.skip



Global variables (fixtures) - browser, page


JavaScript is asynchronous in nature


Execution status of a Line of code called as Promises.

3 types of promises

a. pending
b. rejected
c. resolved

Assertion/ expect : is a feature in testing tool to compare expected values with actual values
both -matching -pass
both -mis-matching -Fail


2 types of expect/Assertions in playwright

1 Hard Assert
2 Soft Assert



Playwright recognizes an element in the page by using 2 locators

1. xpath
2. Css


xpath -Extended path - Address of an object in the webpage


2 types of xpath 
-------------------
a. Absolute xpath / full xpath / complete xpath
html/body/div[1]/header/div/div[4]/div[2]/div/div/a[1]

b. Relative xpath / short xpath
//*[@id="nav-xshop"]/a[1]


Default timeout for loading an element is 30000msec. XXXXXXXX

Default timeout for performing an action on an element is 30000msec.

//input[@data-action-type='DISMISS']

CheckList-Day2
-----------------
0. how to run testscripts serially....
1. Navigate back and forward...
2. TakeScreenShot/Full screenshot /visual validation
2a. arrow functions ...
3. Work with Alert/Dialog...
4. Work with iframe
5. Write manual xpath and css ...
6. select object - select , validation
7. WebTables, Dynamic webtable, AutoSuggest



3 types of userdefined functions
-----------------------------------
1. Named function
2. Arrow function / Lamda functions --> it is function without name, without function and without return keyword
3. Anonymous function : it is a function without name

Ex1: 

function printmsg(){
  console.log("Hello");
}
==
 ()=>{
  console.log("Hello");
}
==
()=>console.log("Hello");

Ex2:
 
function StrLen(str){
   return str.length();
}
==
 (str)=>str.length();
==
str=>str.length();

Ex3:
function add2(num1,num2){
 console.log("sum="+(num1+num2);
}
==
 (num1,num2)=>console.log("sum="+(num1+num2);

Ex4: 
function print1to10(){
   var i=1; 
   while(i<=10){
          console.log(i);
          i++;
  }
}
==
 ()=>{
   var i=1; 
   while(i<=10){
          console.log(i);
          i++;
  }
}

Ex5:
   function mul3(a,b,c){
         return a*b*c;
 }
==
 (a,b,c)=>a*b*c;


Ananymous function
-------------------
Ex1: 

function printmsg(){
     console.log("Hello");
 }
==
function (){
     console.log("Hello");
 }

Ex2:
   function mul3(a,b,c){
         return a*b*c;
 }
==
   function (a,b,c){
         return a*b*c;
 }


Listeners
-------------
//tagName[@attrname='attrvalue']
//input[@name='proceed']



Manual xpath/Customized xpath
---------------------------------
1. if xpath is associated with dynamic id.

2. if AUT works only with opera, safari 

3. if you want to create a script to recognize an element irrespective of the position of the object


//*[@id="u_0_5_il"]
//*[@id="u_0_5_Xt"]
//*[@id="u_0_0_/a"]

(//a[text()='Demo'])[1]
(//a[text()='Demo'])[2]
//a[text()='Today's Deals']
//a[text()='Added to cart']

partial text
----------------
//tagName[contains(text(),'partialtext')]
//h1[text()='Added to cart']
//h1[contains(text(),'Added')]
//h1[contains(text(),'cart')]
//h1[contains(text(),'Added to cart')]


CSS
----
General formate to write Css
-----------------------------

tagName[attrname='attrvalue']

input[name='username']
#id  ---->css for an element
#loginButton
.className --->css for an element
.textField


div #navbar-collapse-header > div >a:nth-child(1) -Login
div #navbar-collapse-header > div >a:nth-child(2) -Register


iframe -css for a frame
//iframe - xpath for a frame
